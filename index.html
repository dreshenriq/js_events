        <p>By Andres Henriquez</p>

        <p>I learned how to use JavaScript events like onmouseover and onmouseleave this week. Try out my chosen events by hovering your mouse over the first image and by clicking the second... The Dachshund is a popular dog breed around the world. If you haven't considered one, this website will give you a little bit more insight about them. Maybe you'll adopt one soon enough! </p>

        <p>There are various types of coats and colrs that dachshunds come in. They come in a smoothhaired,longhaired. or wirehaired. The longhaired kind have smooth and silky fur. It's quite wispy and can grow to be quite long. The more popular variant is the smooth coat as it is easiest to maintain. The most uncommon coat is the wiry type. Wirehaired dachshunds tend to look more like terriers. </p>

        <h2>Temperment</h2>

        <p>The dachshund was bred in Germany to be a hunting dog. Therefore, the breed has attained a sort of "tough" temperment. Though small, these dogs make up for their size in bark and bite. They can be quite stubborn, so they may not always be the easiest dog to train. Dachshunds are known for their devotion to their owners, but can be quite standoffish to strangers. </p>
